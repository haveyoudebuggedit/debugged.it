I already [wrote an article on my CDN](https://pasztor.at/blog/building-your-own-cdn), but this time we are going
in-depth, taking a look at AWS, what it's good at and what is lacking, building our own content delivery network.

If you are located in Vienna, Austria, drop by the
[Millenium Tower on the 3rd of March](https://www.meetup.com/Amazon-Web-Services-AWS-Vienna/events/248091566/).
