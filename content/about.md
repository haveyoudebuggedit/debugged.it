We found each other shortly before the lock-downs in face of the 2020 pandemic thanks to a common friend. We moved in after 4 days and spent 4 months cooped up on <span role="text" aria-label="48 square meters">48 m²</span> (<span role="text" aria-label="500 square feet">500 ft²</span>), only going out for bare necessities. 

Wholeheartedly embracing our <span role="text" aria-label="gheekyness">geekiness</span>, we built ourselves a computer corner in our living room. When not sitting in front of our screens, we enjoy a good hike or climb in nature.
