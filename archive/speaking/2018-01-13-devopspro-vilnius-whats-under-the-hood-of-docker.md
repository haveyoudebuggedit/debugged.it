summary: Join me and learn how the new Linux kernel features sparked the container
  revolution, and how these things actually work. This talk will contain some C code,
  but fear not, we will keep it simple. This is something every DevOps Engineer working
  with containers should understand.

title: Whatâ€™s under the hood of Docker? Process separation in the Linux kernel

DevOps Pro Vilnius was one of the best conferences I've been to. Not only did the conference organizers do everything in
their power to make us feel welcome, they also did an excellent job at picking my fellow speakers. I had a blast 
talking about how Docker works under the hood and what the individual features in the Linux kernel are it uses to
achieve process level separation. The organizers even had enough forethought to put
[Phil Estes'](https://twitter.com/estesp) talk on container security directly after mine, letting us link our talks
together.

My slides can be found on the link below and the video will be up in a few weeks.
